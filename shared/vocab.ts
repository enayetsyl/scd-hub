// SCHOOLSW — /shared controlled-vocabulary enums + role→permission map
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Doc ID : SCHOOLSW-SHARED-VOCAB
// Version: v1.0 (LOCKED 2026-06-09, D-PROJ04-005) — Project-04 ratification of the question payload (R-IMP5):
//          QuestionType confirmed; PaperRole added (MIRRORED); DocType += "stimulus".
// Owner  : Principal
// Path   : monorepo `/shared/vocab.ts`  (REQ §8, ARCH §2)
// Sources: REQ §5 (R-AC1 RBAC, R-AC2 PoLP, R-AC3 row-scope), §4 R-IMP1 outer
//          contract; ARCH ADR-004 (resolver authz), ADR-005 (two planes/firewall);
//          docs/import-contract.schema.json (the wire-contract enums).
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS
//   The single TypeScript source of truth for (A) the app's controlled vocabulary
//   and (B) the action-level RBAC map. `/app` UI, `/server` resolvers, and the
//   codegen layer all import from here. `as const` arrays give both runtime values
//   (dropdowns, validation, label lookup) and compile-time union types, so a change
//   here is a compile-time break across all three clients (R-API1), not a runtime
//   crash on a teacher's phone.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
//   - Not the enforcement layer. RBAC here is *grants only*; row-scope and the
//     plane boundary are enforced in resolvers (ADR-004). SCOPE_RULES below is the
//     coordination reference the resolver layer reads, not a runtime guard.
//   - Not the wire contract. The envelope JSON Schema is a SEPARATE source of truth
//     for what arrives at import. The two MUST agree — see "TWO-PLACE SYNC" below.
//
// TWO-PLACE SYNC (do not skip)
//   Any add/rename to a MIRRORED enum (Subject, DocType, CurationTag, BloomLevel,
//   Difficulty, QuestionType, PaperRole, ReviewStatus, SourceProject, AnchorWord) is a
//   two-place edit: this file AND docs/import-contract.schema.json (and the
//   harness consistency() gate). The shipped verifier (verify_shared_vocab.mjs)
//   fails CI if they drift. App-native vocab (SetType, TrackerKind, Role,
//   Permission, Section default) lives ONLY here — it has no wire-contract twin.
//
// HOW TO EXTEND (stepwise)
//   1. Add the value to the relevant `as const` array below.
//   2. If it is a MIRRORED enum, make the matching edit in the envelope schema +
//      harness, then re-run the verifier.
//   3. If it is a new Permission, add it to PERMISSIONS, grant it to roles in
//      ROLE_PERMISSIONS, and set PERMISSION_BUILD_STATUS (build | pipeline).
//   4. Add a Bangla label in the relevant LABELS_BN map if the value is surfaced
//      in the UI (NFR-5: Bangla labels, English codes).
//   5. Re-run `tsc --noEmit` + the verifier; both must be green before commit.
//
// THE FIREWALL (ADR-005) — read once
//   NONE of the permissions below grant corpus/analytics-plane access to identity.
//   The analytics/export resolvers are wired to the corpus plane and have no
//   resolver path to students/guardians/users. That isolation is structural, not a
//   permission; the fail-closed firewall test (NFR-11) asserts it. Do not add an
//   "analytics:*" permission that reaches identity — it would defeat R-X8/R-AC4.
