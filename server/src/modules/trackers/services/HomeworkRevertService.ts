/**
 * HomeworkRevertService (D-#338) — undo a mistaken lifecycle action on ONE
 * homework student record: pop the last ACTION (the trailing run of stateDates
 * stamps sharing the final stamp's timestamp — multi-hop mutations write one
 * timestamp per action) and restore the previous state, cleaning up the
 * popped stamps' side effects.
 *
 * Policy (owner 2026-07-19, widened 2026-09-08 by D-#650): the ACTING teacher
 * may revert their own last action for up to REVERT_WINDOW_DAYS (30) Dhaka
 * days; Principal/Office (`admin`) anytime. Blocked for everyone when
 * downstream work exists (a spawned resubmission that has progressed / carries
 * an answer file).
 *
 * Accepted, deliberately NOT blocked (documented):
 *  - guardian notifications already sent (chase / results) cannot be unsent;
 *    the emitters' per-day dedupe prevents double-notifying on a redo;
 *  - a reconciled day does NOT block record reverts — reconciliation freezes
 *    the Layer-A declare/trim ledger; these Layer-B pops never touch
 *    dayTotal/trimLog, and issuance itself is never undone (the entry stamp
 *    is never popped);
 *  - the answer file stays attached (an attachment is not a lifecycle side
 *    effect).
